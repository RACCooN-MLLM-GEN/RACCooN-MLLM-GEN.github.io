            Recent video generative models primarily rely on carefully written text prompts for specific tasks, like inpainting or style editing. They require labor-intensive textual descriptions for input videos, hindering their flexibility to adapt personal/raw videos to user specifications. This paper proposes RACCooN, a versatile and user-friendly video-to-paragraph-to-video generative framework that supports multiple video editing capabilities such as removal, addition, and modification, through a unified pipeline. RACCooN consists of two principal stages: Video-to-Paragraph (V2P) and Paragraph-to-Video (P2V). In the V2P stage, we automatically describe video scenes in well-structured natural language, capturing both the holistic context and focused object details. Subsequently, in the P2V stage, users can optionally refine these descriptions to guide the video diffusion model, enabling various modifica- tions to the input video, such as removing, changing subjects, and/or adding new objects. The proposed approach stands out from other methods through several significant contributions: (1) RACCooN suggests a multi-granular spatiotemporal pooling strategy to generate well-structured video descriptions, capturing both the broad context and object details without requiring complex human annotations, simplifying precise video content editing based on text for users. (2) Our video generative model incorporates auto-generated narratives or instructions to enhance the quality and accuracy of the generated content. It supports the addition of video objects, inpainting, and attribute modification within a unified framework, surpassing existing video editing and inpainting benchmarks. The proposed framework demonstrates impressive versatile capabilities in video-to-paragraph generation (up to 10.8% ↑ relative improvement in human evaluations against the baseline), video content editing (relative 49.7% ↑ in FVD), and can be incorporated into other SoTA video generative models for further enhancement

         <b>Figure2: Illustration of RACCooN framework</b>. RACCooN generates video descriptions with the three distinct pooled visual tokens, including Multi-Granular Spatiotemporal (MGS) Pooling. Next, the user can edit the generated descriptions by adding, removing, or modifying words to create new videos. Note that for adding object tasks, if users do not provide layout information for the objects they want to add, RACCooN can predict the target layout in each frame.

                We conducted a quantitative evaluation of our proposed RACCooN framework's video-to-paragraph generation capabilities, comparing it against strong baselines with a focus on object-centric captioning and object layout planning. The results, summarized in Table 1, show that open-source video-LLMs (e.g., PG-VL, Video-Chat) which have smaller LLMs (< 13B parameters), struggle with object-centric captioning and usually fail to generate layout planning. This is primarily due to their lack of instructional fine-tuning and insufficient video detail modeling without multi-granular pooling. In contrast, our RACCooN framework demonstrates superior performance in both object-centric captioning and complex object layout planning, benefiting from the instructional tuning on our VPLM dataset. Additionally, our method achieves competitive performance with proprietary MLLMs (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro, GPT-4o) in key object captioning and layout planning, demonstrating its superior instruction following and generation quality.

              <p class="content has-text-justified">
                As shown in Table 3, we quantitatively compare the video editing ability of RACCooN with strong video editing models based on inpainting or DDIM-inversion across three object-centric video content editing subtasks: object changing, removal, and adding. In general, RACCooN outperforms all baselines across 9 metrics. For object changing, RACCooN outperforms the best-performing baseline by 0.8% on CLIP-T, indicating better video-text alignment while maintaining temporal consistency, as demonstrated by comparable CLIP-F and Qedit scores. Note that LGVI is not designed to alter video attributes and tends to preserve video content with marginal change (i.e., identical input and output videos), resulting in improved CLIP-F scores. In the object removal task, RACCooN shows significant improvements over strong baselines (relatively +57.8% FVD, +2.5% SSIM, +9.6% PSNR). Such improvements are maintained in the addition task (relatively+41.6% FVD, +4.3% PSNR). Meanwhile, some DDIM inversion-based models (e.g., TokenFlow) work well for specific tasks (change objects), but do not handle other types of editing. In contrast, our method is an all-rounder player that enables diverse video content editing skills.
